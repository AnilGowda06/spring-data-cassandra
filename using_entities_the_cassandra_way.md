need to create an example to base the code on.
- could use the datastax "killrvideo" use diagrams and flows if I cant come up with anything (need to say where it came from)

a person has friends 
freinds have their own friends
a person has details about themselves
a person has opinions on other people

need to be able to search all people (by location/age/name)
- would be a good example of 1 query per table, to have all 3 of these available.
